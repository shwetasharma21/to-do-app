					You may better arrange your work and stay on top of chores by using
					to-do lists. Having an effective digital to-do list facilitates task
					completion and increases the likelihood of meeting deadlines. Make
					adding and organising jobs quick and easy. A task should ideally be
					added and categorised with just a few keystrokes or touches. Offer a
					variety of options for task organisation. The greatest to-do
					applications have at least a few categories such as these. Features
					like tags, lists, projects, and due dates are all beneficial. Bring up
					the self-imposed deadlines with you. If you're using an online to-do
					list, it should assist you keep track of what has to get done when
					through notifications, widgets, and emails. Present hygienic user
					interfaces. The greatest to-do app integrates with your workflow so
					you can resume your intended tasks. Sync across all of your platforms.
					The platforms you use will vary, but I didn't take anything that
					doesn't sync between desktop and mobile devices into account.
